# Note: the server uses dotenv and will automatically load a .env found in the project root. 
# This development/test env file is mounted to the service's node-dev-docker-env container as its .env

# USAGE: use the `environment` field in the relevant docker-compose service for default/permanent dev env configuration,
# use this file to override/add environment variables without needing to restart the whole docker compose environment;
# the node-dev-docker-env containers watch the mounted reference to this file for changes and live-reload the service as needed.

# IMPORTANT: it's on you to clean up your temporary values/reflect changes you want committed/persisted to the docker-compose file,
# local changes to these overrides not matching across dev's computers, CI, etc is a likely cause of "works on my machine" bugs
